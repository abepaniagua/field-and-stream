# field-and-stream
Field and Stream promotional email built using HTML and CSS.

Field and Stream, a company by Dick's Sporting goods, sends a promotional email every week. And although, the email itself is responsive, there are a few sections that do not look "pixel perfect" and lack symmetry. This affects the overall design of the email when it is opened in different devices. I took the design and assets from the email and remade it so that every section is pixel perfect, responsive and shows symmmetry throughout.
